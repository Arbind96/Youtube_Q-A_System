# Youtube_Q-A_System


The YouTube Q&A System is a Python project designed to streamline the process of extracting audio from YouTube videos, converting it to text, and then applying a question-answering model to generate insights from the content. This tool is particularly useful for educators, researchers, and content creators who need to quickly obtain information from video content without manually transcribing or watching entire videos.

### Features

- **Video Download**: Automatically downloads YouTube videos to a specified directory.
- **Audio Extraction**: Converts the downloaded video into an audio file, facilitating easier processing and analysis.
- **Speech Recognition**: Transcribes the audio content to text, making it searchable and analyzable.
- **Question Answering**: Applies advanced NLP models to answer questions based on the transcribed text, offering a powerful way to extract specific information from video content.

### Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `transformers`, `torch`, `torchvision`, `moviepy`, `pytube`, `SpeechRecognition`

### Setup and Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install transformers torch torchvision moviepy pytube SpeechRecognition
   ```

3. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the Jupyter notebook directly.

### Usage

1. **Download a YouTube Video**: Specify the URL of the YouTube video you wish to analyze.
   
   ```python
   from pytube import YouTube

   video_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id"
   download_youtube_video(video_url, 'path/to/download/directory')
   ```

2. **Extract Audio from the Video**: Convert the downloaded video into an audio file (.wav format) for processing.
   
   ```python
   from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip

   extract_audio_from_video('path/to/video/file', 'path/to/output/directory')
   ```

3. **Transcribe Audio to Text**: Use the speech recognition library to convert audio content to text. (Further implementation details expected in the notebook.)

4. **Answer Questions Based on Transcribed Text**: Utilize a pre-trained model to answer questions based on the content of the video. (Further implementation details expected in the notebook.)
